# BUG-FIX
Added "-legacy-drawing" to fix gray screen issue from [Termux-x11](https://github.com/termux/termux-x11?tab=readme-ov-file#running-graphical-applications).
Now it Should work.

Note if you already installed Box64droid from original github, you don't need to reinstall it, just change scripts with those from releases.

Note 2: Box64Droid is goes to /data/user/0/com.termux/files/usr/bin 
And start-box64, start-box64droid goes to /data/user/0/com.termux/files/home/

Also fixed some localization issues for non-root and virgl versions.


# Box64Droid
Box64Droid is a project with scripts that automate installing preconfigured rootfs with [Box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64), [Box86](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86), [Wine Stable 8.0](https://github.com/Kron4ek/Wine-Builds), [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk), [D8VK](https://github.com/AlpyneDreams/d8vk) on Android. Originally was a [fork](https://github.com/Ilya114/Box4Droid) of [Box4Droid](https://github.com/Herick75/Box4Droid) with Box64. Can't launch all games in the world in 4K 60 FPS, note it when you are trying launch AAA games. Project site available [here](https://ilya114.github.io/Box64Droid/). 

Made by guy from [Lysychansk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysychansk), [Luhansk region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk_Oblast) of Ukraine.

## Installation instructions
1. Install [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/download/v0.118.0/termux-app_v0.118.0+github-debug_arm64-v8a.apk) and [Termux-x11](https://github.com/Ilya114/Box64Droid/releases/download/stable/app-arm64-v8a-debug.apk).
2. In Termux run the Box64Droid install command: `curl -o install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nes2525/Box64Droid-bug-fix/main/scripts/install && chmod +x install && ./install`

After the installation is completed, run `box64droid --start`. The starting script will start Termux-X11 and show the start menu.

You also can use Input Bridge, install 0.1.9 apk then just run app in Android and in Wine from start menu.

## System requirements 

- Modern gpu (ie. your phone must be made after 2018) (Other GPUs are supported by VirGL, but many games might not work)
- Android 12+ (non-root, VirGL version), Android 10+ (root version)
- 6+ GB ram (ideal 8+)
- 64-bit Android
- You also need ~4,2GB (for root version), 4,5GB (for non-root version) or ~3,3GB (for VirGL version) worth of free space for the installation to run without problems.

If you want to get more FPS and stability, use the root version (you will need root rights on your device).

## Configuring

You can choose to use environment variables, there are 3 files, `DXVK_D8VK.conf`, `Box64Droid.conf` and `DXVK_D8VK.conf`. These files are created and found in the `/sdcard/Box64Droid/` folder after the first Box64Droid run.

The `Box64Droid.conf` file is with rootfs, Box86, Box64 and Wine configuration. You can use the Box86 and Box64 environment variables, see all of them [here](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md#) and [here](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md). You can add as many variables as you like.
The `DXVK_D8VK_HUD.conf` file is for you to use the environment variables referring to [DXVK_HUD](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk#hud).

The `DXVK_D8VK.conf` file is for you to use the environment variables referring to [dxvk](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/blob/master/dxvk.conf).

## Known issues

- Error when updating Termux packages. Clearing Termux data will help.
- Android 12+ can kill Termux, you may get `[Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter]`. To fix it run this command in adb shell from your pc: `adb shell "/system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647"`
- "Control" menu in Wine (in Wine Proton 8.0-2 working fine) shows nothing. You can just open `control` using "Run" (Win + R).
- Winetricks runs a long of time when Proton installed (non-root version).
- Wine GE 8.14 and above and Wine 8.14 and above have broken DXVK with drivers for Adreno 7xx/610. Install any Wine version before 8.14.

## Instructions on how to mount SD-card external HDD/SSD (chroot version only)

If you want mount a sdcard or a external drive (HDD/SSD), you need to add the mountpoint maually, follow these steps:

1. Mount the drive onto the phone storage:
    - For SD-card go to /storage and see (`sudo ls`) folder example `8D3E-2B7K`.
    - For external drives go to /mnt/media_rw and see folder like `C3G3H6B8A56212H7`.
2. Mount the drive into the chroot envrionment:
    - Type `nano $PREFIX/bin/box64droid` and add the mount command before the `sudo chroot login ...` line: `sudo mount --bind /mnt/media_rw/drivename (or /storage/sdcardname) $ROOTFSPATH/needfolder`. 
    - You need to create `needfolder` yourself in ~/ubuntu folder by using `sudo mkdir foldername`.

## Things to note

Some issues/instabilities can happen when using Box86 and Box64 in a proot environment, so it's not recommended to use Box86 and Box64 in proot as a debug/testing environment, there are far better options for that.
